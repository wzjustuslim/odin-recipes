  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Glazed carrots coated in a mixture of brown sugar and butter are a versatile side dish you can serve alongside a weeknight meatloaf, a Sunday ham, or your Thanksgiving turkey. These caramelized carrots are a definite kid-pleaser but they're elegant enough to impress the adults as well! </p>
  <p>Allow the glazed carrots to cool completely, then transfer to an airtight container. Store your leftovers in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. We don't recommend freezing these glazed carrots, as the texture will become mushy during the thawing process. </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds carrots, peeled and cut into sticks</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Cut broccoli florets from the stalk. Peel the stalk and slice into 1/4-inch slices. Mix florets and stem pieces with olive oil in a bowl and transfer to a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until broccoli is tender and lightly browned, about 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
